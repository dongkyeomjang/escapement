"""Offline bound on what deferring a session's return could buy.

The policy question this answers is narrow on purpose. A session finishes its
tool call at some instant; the engine could hand the turn back right then, or
hold it for up to a latency budget. Holding changes several things at once:
the batch the returning turn lands in, whether its prefix is still cached, and
when its prefill stops everyone else.

Whether those ever line up is not obvious from the substrate model alone, so
this module searches. What it returns is an *achievable* schedule, which makes
it a lower bound on the true optimum -- and that asymmetry is the right way
round for the question: if even a good search finds nothing, there is no
headroom to build a policy on.

One accounting point decides how the results read. Decode work is conserved:
the plan fixes how many tokens must be produced, so ``sum(actual)`` over decode
steps is the same for every schedule. What a schedule changes is the *batch
each token rides in*, and a padded wide batch costs less per token than a
narrow one. Device time and slot occupancy can therefore move in opposite
directions, and only device time is a cost.

Nothing here decides anything at run time. It is an offline calculation on
plans that were already measured, used to decide whether a policy is worth
designing at all.
