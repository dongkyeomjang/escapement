"""Deterministic step-level simulator for a bucketed, prefill-exclusive engine.

The engine being modelled schedules in whole steps and never mixes the two
kinds of work: if any request is waiting to be admitted, exactly one is
admitted and its prefill owns the step, so every session already decoding
stops. Otherwise every running request advances by one token inside a padded
batch whose width is the smallest compiled bucket that fits them.

That is the whole scheduler. Everything interesting -- padding waste, the
serialization tax, whether a returning session still finds its prefix --
follows from those two rules plus the outer-block pool in ``cache.py``.

The simulator is deterministic by construction. Real runs are not: threads
start in whatever order the OS picks, so the admission order of requests that
arrive at the same instant is not reproducible. ``SimConfig.arrival_order``
names the tie-break used instead, and ``TASK24`` measures what that assumption
costs.

Nothing here names an accelerator: every constant comes from the descriptor.
