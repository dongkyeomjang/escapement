"""Outer-block pool with the allocate-then-look-up ordering that decides reuse.

The pool is the substrate's second cache layer: a small fixed number of large
blocks, each holding one session's prefix. What makes it worth simulating is
not its size but the *order* of two operations. A newly admitted request first
takes a block -- evicting one if none is free -- and only afterwards asks
whether its own prefix is still cached. A request can therefore evict the very
entry it was about to reuse, or evict a peer that is about to come back.

Nothing here names an accelerator. The block count, the block size and the
eviction order all come from the descriptor.
